# Identification_of_lymphocyte_WBC_in_Blood
1.	The input images provided to the code are peripheral blood smear images.
2.	With the input image given techniques like erosion and dilation are done using a disk shaped structuring element. Along with this identifying the circled images     using ‘radius range’, ‘object polarity [bright]’, sensitivity
3.	This will determine the circular object’s which are dark. When compared to finding these objects in a peripheral blood smear image, the WBC’s that are round in shape     will determine the presence of lymphocytes.
