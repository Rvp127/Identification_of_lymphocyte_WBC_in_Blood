# Identification_of_lymphocyte_WBC_in_Blood
1.	The input images provided to the code are peripheral blood smear images.
2. Developed a MATLAB program for analyzing peripheral blood smear images to count and characterize blood cells, aiding in medical diagnostics.
3. <u>Image Preprocessing</u>: Implemented functions to read and preprocess input images, including resizing and labeling.
4. <u>Morphological Reconstruction</u>: Applied erosion and dilation operations to reconstruct images for accurate cell detection.
5. <u>Binary Image Conversion</u>: Converted RGB images to binary format based on predefined threshold values, facilitating cell segmentation.
6. <u>Morphological Operations</u>: Conducted morphological operations to refine segmented images, removing noise and enhancing clarity.
7. <u>Cell Counting</u>: Utilized circular Hough transform for cell detection, accurately counting cells and visualizing results.

**Validation and Results:**
Validated the program's accuracy by analyzing 36 validation images, comparing results with expert pathologist findings. Visual representations were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the analysis.

**Tools Used:** MATLAB, Image Processing Toolbox

This project showcases proficiency in image processing techniques and demonstrates the ability to develop practical solutions for medical image analysis.
